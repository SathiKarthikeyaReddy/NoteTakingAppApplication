## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

1. **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 17 or later.
   - You can download it from [AdoptOpenJDK](<https://adoptopenjdk.net/>) or [Oracle](<https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html>).
   - Verify installation:
     bash
     java -version
     
2. **Apache Maven**: Version 3.6.0 or later.
   - Download from [Apache Maven](<https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi>).
   - After installation, add Maven to your system's PATH.
   - Verify installation:
     bash
     mvn -v
     
3. **Node.js** (optional): If you want to use Node.js for serving the frontend, download from [Node.js](<https://nodejs.org/>).

### Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:
bash
git clone <https://github.com/yourusername/note-taking-app.git>
cd note-taking-app


### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:

```bash
   cd frontend

```

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser directly or use a local server for better compatibility (recommended). If you have Python installed, you can run:

```bash
   python -m http.server 8000

```

- Then, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000/index.html`.

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:

```bash
   cd ../backend

```

1. Build the project using Maven:

```bash
   mvn clean install

```

1. Run the Spring Boot application:

```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run

```

### Running the Application

1. Ensure the backend server is running on `http://localhost:8080`.
2. Open the frontend (either directly or using a local server).
3. You can start creating and saving notes!

## Usage

- Write your notes in the provided textarea.
- Click the "Save Note" button to store your note.
- The saved notes will be displayed below the textarea.

## Troubleshooting

- **CORS Issues**: If you encounter CORS issues when accessing the backend from the frontend, ensure you are using a local server for the frontend or configure CORS in the Spring Boot application.
- **Backend Not Running**: Ensure that the Spring Boot application is running without errors. Check the terminal for any logs.
- **Network Errors**: Check the browser's console (F12) for any network-related errors when trying to save notes.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions for improvements or want to add features, feel free to fork the repository and create a pull request.
